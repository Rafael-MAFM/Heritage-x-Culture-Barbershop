Heritage x Culture Barbershop Website - Product Requirements Document
=====================================================================

<context>
# Overview
The Heritage x Culture Barbershop website is a premium appointment booking platform designed to streamline the customer booking experience for this highly-rated Campbell, CA barbershop. The platform addresses the need for a sophisticated, user-friendly online presence that matches the shop's premium service quality while making it effortless for customers to book appointments with their preferred barber. With 8 skilled barbers and a 5.0-star rating, Heritage x Culture has established itself as a premier destination for men's grooming in the Bay Area, and this website will reflect that excellence through its design and functionality.

# UI/UX Principles
The website embraces a bold, premium aesthetic that blends traditional barbershop heritage with modern urban culture. The design philosophy centers on the powerful gorilla logo, incorporating black, white, and gold accents throughout. The interface features smooth animations, parallax scrolling effects, and subtle hover interactions that create an engaging yet professional experience. Typography combines bold serif fonts for headers (evoking traditional barbershop signage) with clean sans-serif for body text. Shadow effects and glassmorphism elements add depth and sophistication. The site is fully responsive with a mobile-first approach, ensuring seamless booking from any device. Loading animations feature the gorilla logo, and micro-interactions provide feedback for every user action.
